##### Hey there, I'm drowsy. I was born in 2008; my dad liked computers and would run Linux and do all sorts of things. I watched him and wanted to do what he did, and from there my love for computers grew. Not too long later I started coding and messing around with computers. From there I kept learning more and writing more, Now here I am years later still writing code.
